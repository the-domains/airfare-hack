  A few days ago, a friend of mine asked me about Low Cost Carriers in Japan. As
  the demographics have changed, the Japanese government opened up more airports
  to more flights. The results have been significantly improved connections to
  secondary cities and thirteen low cost carriers that are now serving Narita
  Airport.
